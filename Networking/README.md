# NETWORKING

The base of networking is to allow players to play on the same party. We can achieve this with the help of ASIO :
<ul>
    <li>cross-platform C++ library</li>
    <li>Low-level I/O programing</li>
    <li>Asynchronous model using modern C++</li>
</ul>
With this methode we can build a server using IPC (Inter Process Communication) with a TCP/IP network.

The goal of our networking is give players the possibility to host their parties and play together.
