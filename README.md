# R-TYPE Project

This game is informally called a Horizontal Shmup (e.g. Shoot’em’up), and while R-Type is not the first one of its category, this one has been a huge success amongst gamers in the 90’s, and had several ports, spin-offs, and 3D remakes on modern systems.

Other similar and well known games are the Gradius series and Blazing Star on Neo Geo.
